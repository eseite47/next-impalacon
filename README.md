## Impala

Impala is making the process of booking hotel rooms ridiculously easy. Weâ€™re providing hotels with a powerful data distribution infrastructure that transforms the way hotel guests across the world browse, book, stay and pay. Think Twilio for Travel.


We launched our original API product in January 2019 and since then have grown at - quite frankly - a ridiculous old clip. Our technology is already installed in hundreds of hotels worldwide, on six continents and categorises more than 1 billion data points. This has allowed us to bring forward our ambition to revolutionise the hotel distribution market and help empower millions of people across the globe.

## We're Hiring!

We are a growing remote-first team of exceptional people split across engineering, product and commercial who make up a thriving, active, supportive community.
